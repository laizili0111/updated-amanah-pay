                  <h2>Islamic Financial Principles</h2>
                  <p>
                    At Faith Finance Forward, every aspect of our platform is designed to uphold the fundamental principles of Islamic finance. We recognize the importance of ensuring that all donations and transactions comply with Shariah guidelines.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3>Key Islamic Financial Principles We Uphold:</h3>
                  
                  <h4>1. Prohibition of Riba (Interest)</h4>
                  <p>
                    Our platform is completely free from interest-based transactions. Any funds collected are never invested in interest-bearing instruments, and all financial activities strictly avoid Riba in any form.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h4>2. Zakat Compliance</h4>
                  <p>
                    We provide specialized tools to help Muslims calculate and distribute their Zakat according to Islamic guidelines. Our Zakat campaigns ensure that funds reach eligible recipients as defined by Islamic law.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h4>3. Transparency (Amanah)</h4>
                  <p>
                    Blockchain technology allows us to fulfill the Islamic principle of Amanah (trustworthiness) by providing complete transparency in how funds are collected, managed, and distributed.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h4>4. Ethical Investment (Halal)</h4>
                  <p>
                    Any temporary holding of funds within our system is done in compliance with Halal investment principles, avoiding industries and activities prohibited in Islam.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3>Shariah Advisory Board</h3>
                  <p>
                    Our platform is regularly reviewed by a board of qualified Islamic scholars who ensure that all aspects of our operations remain Shariah-compliant. They provide guidance on campaign selection, fund management, and technological implementations to maintain adherence to Islamic principles.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Blockchain Technology</h2>
                  <p>
                    Faith Finance Forward leverages the power of blockchain technology to revolutionize Islamic charitable giving, ensuring unprecedented levels of transparency, security, and efficiency.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3>How We Use Blockchain</h3>
                  
                  <h4>Transparent Donation Tracking</h4>
                  <p>
                    Every donation made through our platform is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable record that can be verified by anyone. This allows donors to track exactly where their funds go and how they are used.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h4>Smart Contracts for Automated Compliance</h4>
                  <p>
                    We use smart contracts to automate the enforcement of Islamic financial principles. These self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code ensure that funds are only used in ways that comply with Shariah guidelines.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h4>Seamless Fiat-to-Crypto Conversion</h4>
                  <p>
                    Our platform allows donors to contribute using traditional currencies (fiat), which are then automatically converted to cryptocurrencies for blockchain processing. This makes the technology accessible to everyone, regardless of their familiarity with crypto.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h4>Reduced Transaction Costs</h4>
                  <p>
                    By using blockchain technology, we significantly reduce the transaction fees associated with international transfers, ensuring that more of each donation reaches its intended recipient.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3>Technical Infrastructure</h3>
                  <p>
                    Our platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain, chosen for its established ecosystem and smart contract capabilities. We've implemented additional layers of security and optimization to ensure fast transaction processing and minimal gas fees.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h4>Blockchain-Specific Features:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Decentralized verification of donation receipt and distribution</li>
                    <li>Multi-signature wallets for enhanced security</li>
                    <li>Optional anonymity for donors who prefer privacy</li>
